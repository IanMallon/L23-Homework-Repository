This Python script generates and displays a simple sine wave using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

Description -
This script plots a sine wave over a range of 0 to 5π. It uses the following libraries:

NumPy: For numerical operations and generating an array of values for the x-axis.
Matplotlib: For plotting the sine wave and displaying it visually.

The sine function is used to generate the y-values, which are then plotted against the x-values.

Features -
Generates a sine wave plot for values between 0 and 5π. 
Customizes the plot color to green.
Displays the graph using Matplotlib's show() method.

Prerequisites -
To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries, matplotlib and numpy.
